# Drum Machine App

This is a fully functional **Drum Machine** built using **React** and **Redux**. The app allows users to play drum sounds by either clicking buttons or pressing specific keys on their keyboard. Users can also toggle the power, switch between two sound banks, and control the volume of the sounds. The display shows the name of the currently playing sound.

## Features

- **Play Sounds**: Press the buttons or the corresponding keys on your keyboard to play different drum sounds.
- **Power Control**: Toggle the power on and off. When the power is off, no sounds will play, and the display will reset.
- **Bank Switch**: Toggle between two sound banks with different sets of drum sounds.
- **Volume Control**: Adjust the volume of the drum sounds using a slider.
- **Display**: Shows the name of the current sound being played.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Redux**: For managing the app's state (power, bank, name).

- **CSS**: For styling the app.
